# BG Remover

Hey there! üëã Thanks for checking out my background remover tool. I built this during a weekend coding binge when I got tired of using online tools that kept watermarking my images or making me pay for downloads.

## What does it do?

Pretty much what it says on the tin - it removes backgrounds from images! But with some nice extras:

- **Simple drag & drop** - Just drag your image in and watch the magic happen
- **Custom background colors** - Want your product on a bright red background? Easy.
- **Direct downloads** - No annoying "create an account to download" nonsense
- **Clean, dark UI** - Because light mode hurts my eyes at 2am

## Demo

## Getting Started

### The easy way:

1. Download the latest release
2. Run `Run_BG_Remover.bat`
3. That's it. Seriously.

### The nerd way (for devs):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/izhan0102/BG_Remover_PC.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run it
python hello_world.py  # (yeah I know, weird filename - long story)
```

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- At least 4GB RAM (those ML models get hungry)
- Some patience for the first run while it downloads the ML model

## How it works

Behind the scenes, this app uses the awesome [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) library, which uses a U^2-Net model to detect foreground objects. I just wrapped it in a nicer UI so you don't have to touch the command line.

## Known Issues

- Processing large images (>4K) might make things a bit sluggish
- Occasionally struggles with very fine details like hair or fur
- Some transparent PNGs may look odd when background color is applied
